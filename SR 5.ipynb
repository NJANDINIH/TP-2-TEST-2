    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the dataset.\n",
    "In each step of the binary search, the dataset size is halved. This logarithmic behavior results in efficient searching, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "As the dataset size increases, the time taken by binary search grows very slowly compared to linearly increasing dataset sizes.\n",
    "Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of binary search is O(1), meaning it requires constant extra space.\n",
    "Binary search operates on the dataset itself without requiring additional data structures to store intermediate results or recursion stacks.\n",
    "Efficiency in terms of Big-O Notation\n",
    "The time complexity of O(log n) indicates that the binary search algorithm scales efficiently with increasing dataset sizes.\n",
    "This logarithmic growth in time complexity means that even for very large datasets, the search time increases slowly, making binary search highly efficient for searching tasks.\n",
    "Additionally, the constant space complexity O(1) ensures that binary search has a minimal memory footprint, making it suitable for memory-constrained environments or applications where memory efficiency is crucial."
